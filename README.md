### About
Abc doesn't have any dependencies and is based on Backbone.js like framework. 
At this editor I have represented my ideas around organization of modular architecture and OOP in javascript.
And I have reached my childhood dream to write my own text editor.

Abc supports code evolution like [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
All projects can be exported at separated file and imported on another device. It hasn't any backend yet.

Current version has partial support of markdown file format.

Supported browsers:
- Chrome
- Opera
- Safari
- Firefox
