## ABC
Abc is online code editor with syntax highlighter, hotkeys and many others features.
[Demo](https://nmalcev.github.io/abc/)

It supports:
- HTML code evolution;
- JS code evolution;
- SVG viewer;
- Markdown viewer (basicle).

### About
Abc doesn't have any dependencies. The project was createded for educational purposes.
At this editor I have represented my ideas around organization of modular architecture and OOP in javascript.
And I have reached my childhood dream to write my own text editor.

Abc supports code evolution like [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/) or [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
All projects can be exported to a separate file and imported to another device. It hasn't any backend yet.
The current version of the application has partial support of markdown file format.


To build a project, you must run the following command:
`npm run build`
The `static/app` folder will contain the executable application.
